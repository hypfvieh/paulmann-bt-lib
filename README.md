# This project will be discontinued!!!
As of 2018-06-29, this project will no longer be maintained and will be removed in the near future.
Paulmann, the company behind the devices this library tries to control, has contacted me and will publish a public API for the devices themself.

So my paulmann-bt-lib is obsolete as it is incomplete and maybe wrong in some parts. 

I suggest that every user should switch to the official library as soon as it is available.
